serf
====

Build your System with Commands, Event Sourcing and Message Passing.


Commands
--------

The Unit of Work to be done. This takes in a request, represented
by a "Message", and returns an "Event" as its result. The command class
is the "Interactor" or "Domain Controller" with respect to performing
Domain Layer business logic in coordinating and interacting with
the Domain Layer's Entities (Value Objects and Entity Gateways).

1. Include the "Serf::Command" module in your class.
2. Implement the 'call(headers, message)' method.
3. Return nil or a Message (Hashie::Mash is recommended).

Notes:

* Exceptions raised out of the command are then caught by Serf and
  transformed into a generic CaughtExceptionEvent Message.
* Multiple Commands may be triggered to execute from a single request Message.

Parcels
-------

A Parcel is just the package of Headers and Message. Serf's convention
represents requests and responses as just Plain Old Hash Objects
(POHO as opposed to PORO) over the Boundaries (see Architecture Lost Years).
This simplifies marshalling over the network. It also gives us easier
semantics in defining Request and Responses without need of extra classes,
code, etc.

The Parcel in Ruby (Datastructure) is represented in two forms:

1. Parcel Pair - [headers, message], a 2 element tuple (Array).
2. Parcel Hash - { headers: headers, message: message}, a 2 element Hash.

NOTE: Hashie::Mash is *Awesome*. (https://github.com/intridea/hashie)
NOTE: Serf passes headers and message as frozen Hashie::Mash instances
  to Commands' call method.
NOTE: Serf mainly deals with, internally, Parcels as Parcel Pairs.

*Messages* are the representation of a Business Request or Business Event.

In the parcel, the message is the business data. It specifies what
business work needs to be done, or what business was done.

  REQUIRED: Required by all messages is the 'kind' field.

The "kind" field identifies the ontological meaning of the message, which
allows Serf to properly pass the message onto the proper Command.
The convention is 'mymodule/requests/my_business_equest' for Requests,
and 'mymodule/events/my_business_event' for Events.

  RECOMMENDED: Use JSON Schema to validate the structure of a message.
    https://github.com/hoxworth/json-schema
    This can be implemented in the 'Policy' chain.

*Headers* are the processing meta data that is associated with a Message.

Headers provide information that would assist in processing, tracking
a Message. But does not provide business relevant information to
the Request or Event Message.

Examples are:
* UUIDs to track request and events, providing a sequential order of
  execution of commands. (Already Implemented by Serf).
* Current User that sent the request. For authentication and authorization.
* Host and Application Server that is processing this request.

Generally, the header information is populated only by the infrastructure
that hosts the business commands. The commands themselves do not
return any headers in the response. The commands are tasked to provide
only business relevant data in the Event messages they return.

Also note that Headers are passed to the commands. This allows commands
to possibly do extra processing based on who made the request.

Policies
--------

Serf implements Policy Chains to validate, check the incoming Parcel before
actually executing a Command.

Example Benefits:
* Authorization to execute Command.
* Validation of Message schema

Policies only need to implement a single method:

    def check!(headers, message)
      raise 'Failure' # To fail the policy, raise an error.
    end
  
Channels
--------

A simple Serf App is a Rack-like app that takes Requests, executes Commands
and returns Events. Channels provide the abstraction for Message Passing
that will feed Events back into Event Handlers (More Serf App Commands),
which can spin off additional business Requests (back into other Serf Apps).
(See CQRS).

Channels just need to implement the following method:

    def push(parcel)
    end

The parcel is a "Parcel Pair". The channel is responsible for serializing
the parcel into a wire-format to transfer over the network to receiving
Serf Apps.

The Domain Layer (from DDD):

1. Entities (Model Entities)- What your application is.
  * Also remember Value Objects.
  * How your Domain Model is structured, but NOT necessarily tied to the
    underlying storage infrastructure.
  * http://rubysource.com/ddd-for-rails-developers-part-2-entities-and-values/
2. Domain Controllers (Interactors) - What your application does.
  * The business logic of coordinating different entities.
    Different than a Rails controller.

  * Your Rails Application is Missing a Domain Controller

3. There is a balancing game of what business logic code lives in an
    Entity vs a Domain Controller... Do what works for you.

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
