Serf drives the incoming requests using runners. Each runner
is implemented to either perform tasks synchronously or asynchronously.
For asynchronous background processing, we rely on third party
libraries. The following is a list of current and (hopefully) future
libraries we hope to support.

Implemented Runners:
  * EventMachine http://rubyeventmachine.com/
  * GirlFriday https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday

TBD ThreadPool Libraries:
  * ThreadPool https://github.com/danielbush/ThreadPool
  * Threadz https://github.com/nanodeath/threadz
  * Celluloid https://github.com/tarcieri/celluloid
  * Resque https://github.com/defunkt/resque
  * DelayedJob https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job
