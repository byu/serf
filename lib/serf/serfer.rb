    # Do the work of processing the env.

    # 2. Turn endpoints into actual handlers that can be called by runners.
    # 3. Call runner to process the endpoints
    # 4. Return results
    #
    # NOTES:
    # * Any error in matching will be raised to the caller, not absorbed by
    #   the error handler.
    # * Any error in Handler creation from endpoint will be caught by the
    #   error handler, (1) pushed to the error channel and (2)
    #   an error event will included in the results pass back to caller.
    #   (a) There may be successul handlers created that can complete.
    # * If the runner raises an error, it will be caught and the error
    #   event will be appended to the results. This is so one
    #   runner failure will not affect another runner's run.
    #   Each runner SHOULD do their own error handling so errors in
    #   one handler will not affect another in the list of handlers the runner
    #   is to process.
    # * RUNNERS MUST push errors they catch to the error channel.
